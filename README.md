# 📚 CollegeBook – A Social Media App for College Students

**CollegeBook** is a unique, minimal, and purpose-driven social media platform designed exclusively for college students. Unlike conventional social platforms, CollegeBook is **time-bound**—your account lasts only through your academic course duration. Once you graduate, your account is deleted and a personalized **archive file (PDF/HTML)** of all your activity is delivered to you as a digital memory book.

## 🚀 Vision

To bring together every student in the college ecosystem, whether introverted or outgoing, and create a focused, distraction-free environment for learning, collaboration, and growth.

## 🤝 3. Collab Hub

A powerful space designed to solve a real student pain-point: **finding good teammates** for hackathons or personal projects.

### 🔍 Find & Join Hackathons
- See open hackathon teams seeking members.
- Request to join by submitting your **CollegeBook profile (acts like a mini-resume)** and a short message.
- Team leaders can respond with:
  - ✅ Accept
  - ❌ Reject
  - 🔧 Need Improvement (with feedback)

> 🔒 Until your request is accepted, all communication is request/response only — keeping things structured and goal-oriented.

> 💬 Once a user’s request is **accepted by the team**, a **private team chat group** is created. Only confirmed teammates can chat inside this group, enabling smooth collaboration without unnecessary noise.

### 💡 Start or Join Projects
- Post your **project idea** if you can’t find peers who believe in it.
- Specify your vision, skills needed, and required collaborators.
- Others can request to join your project team.

💬 Still no global chat—interactions are intentional, limited to requests and private group chats once a team is formed.
